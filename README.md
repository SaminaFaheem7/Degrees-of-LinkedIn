# Degrees-of-LinkedIn
 
 Intoduction:-
    When you log in to LinkedIn and search for a profile of someone with whom you are not connected, you might see info related to mutual connections.  This can be useful when trying to get introduced to someone that you don’t already know.  Having a mutual connection make an introduction for you can be more productive than just a cold email.  Or perhaps you’ve heard of 6 Degrees of Separation, which suggests that everyone on earth is connected by no more than 5 intermediate people.  Determining a chain of connections is a classical computer science problem.
